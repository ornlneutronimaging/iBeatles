iBeatles
======

GUI to automatically fit Bragg Edges, calculate and display strain mapping factors. 

Building
--------
Install all the dependencies
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Before doing the normal `python setup.py ...` things you must convert the
`designer/*.ui` files to `ibeatles/interfaces/*.py. 
This is done with
<<<<<<< HEAD
> python setup.py pyuic
=======
> python setup.py pyuic. 

> python setup.py pyrcc

add iBeatles to python path (as well as BraggEdge as right now the library do not seem to work correctly!)
> export PYTHONPATH=/Users/j35/git/iBeatles;/Users/j35/git/BraggEdge/

> python scripts/ibeatles.py

After that, all the normal
[setuptools](https://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html) magic applies.
>>>>>>> export_import_table

Because the current version is still under development, it can be a little bit struggle to get it up and running...do not hesitate to contact me to get help on the installation (j35 at ornl.gov)
